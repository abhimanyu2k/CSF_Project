To Run the game:
  Have the 3 files - main.py, menuu.py and one_player.py in the same folder.
  Run menu.py in the terminal

The goal of this project was to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game. Tic-tac-toe is a classic paper-and pencil game.
The game is played by two players. The game board is a 3x3 grid. The players take turns making marks in the quadrants on the board. One player places Xs and the other player places Os. A player may place one mark per turn. The first player to fill a full row of only their marks in the horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction wins the game.

We used Python and Tkinter GUI tool kit to develop the game. The Tkinter package is what we will use to build the Graphical user interface for the game. We will use player customization to allow players to input their names and choose their representing marks. When a player inputs a mark, the game logic will run to process the player’s move and determine whether there’s a winner. In the case of errors, messages will appear describing invalid moves according to the game rules.

Our biggest challenge was to put all of the functions together to run the game in harmony. We will have to use at least one while loop because the game needs to run until either a player has won, there is a tie, or if the players want to replay the game and other loops to figure out if few conditions have been met.
